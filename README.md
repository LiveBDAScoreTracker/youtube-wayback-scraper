# youtube-wayback-scraper
Scrapes snapshots from the waybackmachine and reports unlisted youtube urls.

Put the urls to the channels you wish to scrape in "youtube-dl-channels.txt", and populate the "youtube-dl-archive.txt" with your yt-dl archive file.

Run the script and you'll discover the file "output_url_results.txt" containing a list of unlisted videos from the channels.

Test the script first with one channel you know has unlisted videos documented on the waybackmachine, or test with the example "youtube-dl-channels.txt" and "youtube-dl-archive.txt" provided.


This code was quickly written with no regard as to any formating. I'm glad I'm not a computer science student, otherwise this would be inexcuseable.
